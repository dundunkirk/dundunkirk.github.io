Welcome to my first blog post!  

As we step into 2026, I would like to share my hopes and goals for the year ahead. This year, I want to focus on personal growth, continuous learning, and spending meaningful time with the people I care about.

Of course, I will revisit my old notes and continue writing here.

## Strengthening Professional Skills

First, I hope to strengthen my professional skills, especially in **programming**. To achieve this, I plan to follow the learning paths and recommendations on [csdiy.wiki](https://csdiy.wiki/) and take several high-quality courses from overseas universities. My goal is not only to complete these courses, but also to apply what I learn through practical projects and hands-on practice.

## Contributing to Open Source in AI Infrastructure

Second, I hope to actively participate in **open-source projects**, particularly in the field of **AI infrastructure**. By contributing to open-source communities, I want to gain a deeper understanding of real-world systems, improve my engineering skills, and collaborate with others who share similar interests.

## Building a Consistent Exercise Routine

Finally, I want to build a consistent **exercise routine**. One of my concrete goals for this year is to complete a **half marathon** with a satisfying result. I see running not only as a way to stay healthy, but also as a practice of discipline and long-term commitment.

I look forward to looking back at this post at the end of the year and seeing how far I have come.
